Zveltio is a self-hosted foundation for building business applications. It bundles the core every business app needs — collections, auth, permissions, real-time, AI, audit trail, automation, file storage, edge functions — into a single binary with an extensible plugin system.

**Use the included plugins to replace your SaaS stack. Build custom applications on the core. Or do both.**

Modern TypeScript stack (Bun + Hono + Postgres). AI-native. GDPR-compliant by default. MIT-licensed.

> 🟢 **Beta (3.0.0-beta.21)** — extensions API + marketplace are API-stable. Engine internals + Studio still iterating. See [Beta caveats](#beta-caveats) for what's locked vs. still moving.

## Build any business app — self-hosted, modern, yours

The engine ships with everything every business application needs. Activate plugins for common domains, or build custom logic on top.

### What's in the engine core

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Dynamic Collections** | Schemaless tables created at runtime. No code-side migrations for routine schema changes. |
| **Auth + RBAC + RLS** | Better-Auth (sessions, OAuth, 2FA, passkeys) + Casbin role policies + Postgres row-level security. |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket + Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY. Live updates without polling. |
| **File storage** | S3-compatible (SeaweedFS bundled, or BYO AWS/MinIO/R2). |
| **AI providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Azure. Semantic search via pgvector, text-to-SQL, schema generation from natural language. |
| **Audit trail** | Every write logged (who, what, when, where). GDPR-ready right-to-erasure. |
| **Edge functions** | Sandboxed TypeScript runtime for custom serverless logic. |
| **Automation flows** | Visual trigger → step builder with DLQ retry and idempotency. |
| **Webhooks** | HMAC-signed outbound webhooks on data changes. |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Isolated tenants with environment branching. |
| **Plugin system** | Engine extensions + Studio extensions, signed, capability-policy sandboxed. |
| **Offline sync** | CRDT-based local-first storage (Electric SQL provider optional). |

### The Studio (admin UI)

A SvelteKit 5 admin panel ships in the same package. Visual collections editor, permissions matrix, query playground, audit log viewer, AI assistant, marketplace browser, dashboard with sparklines + trend deltas. Open `/admin` after install.

Don't like Svelte? The engine exposes everything via REST + WebSocket — bring your own React, Vue, or HTMX admin. The engine is framework-agnostic.

## Your business stack, on your hardware. Build it or borrow it.

Three real ways teams use Zveltio today.

### 1. Replace your SaaS stack

Activate the bundled plugins for the SaaS subscriptions you'd rather not pay for anymore.

| SaaS you might replace | Zveltio plugin |
|---|---|
| HubSpot / Pipedrive | `crm` — contacts, organizations, deals pipeline |
| Hosted IMAP+SMTP / Front | `communications/mail` — full mail client with AI compose |
| Zapier / Make / n8n | engine `/api/flows` — visual automation with DLQ + retry (built-in) |
| Square / Shopify POS | `operations/pos` — point of sale + inventory + procurement |
| Monday / Asana approvals | `workflow/approvals` — multi-step approval chains, SLA tracking |
| Notion / Coda templates | `content/document-templates` — HTML/PDF template engine |
| Cloudflare Workers / Lambda | `developer/edge-functions` — sandboxed TypeScript serverless |
| Contentful / Sanity | `content/page-builder` — block-based CMS with headless API |
| ChatGPT Teams / Copilot | `ai` — multi-provider, native to your data |
| AppSheet / Glide | `developer/views` — kanban, calendar, gallery, map layouts |

A typical SME running 10-15 of these subscriptions saves **€2 000-5 000 / month** — without per-seat fees.

### 2. Build a vertical product

Build legal-tech, healthcare-CRM, real-estate-management, ag-tech, education-LMS, fintech-back-office. Don't rewrite auth + admin + permissions + audit for the 47th time.

The engine handles plumbing; you focus on domain logic. A typical vertical SaaS skeleton — collections + auth + RLS + admin UI + REST API — is **0 lines of code** in Zveltio.

### 3. Custom internal tools

Intranet portals. Employee dashboards. Client area portals. Document workflows. Internal analytics. Approval chains tied to your specific process.

Self-hosted, owned, modifiable. No SaaS vendor reading your operations data.

---

## How extensions work

Zveltio extensions are **plugins**, not forks. Two types ship together:

### Engine extensions
- TypeScript modules that mount Hono routes at `/ext/<name>/`, declare migrations, hook pre/post-write triggers, alter queries, gate entity access, run cron jobs.
- Signed with Ed25519 at publish time, verified at install.
- Capability-policy sandboxed — explicit `db.read` / `db.write` / `fetch.https` / `crypto.subtle` / `env.read` grants. Denials logged.
- Optional WASM runtime for strict isolation (Rust / TinyGo / AssemblyScript).

### Studio extensions
- Svelte 5 components packaged at publish time, copied into the Studio route tree on enable.
- Register slots, form-alter hooks, custom field types via typed SDK imports (`@zveltio/sdk/studio`).

### Installation model
- Engine downloads signed archives from the marketplace (registry verified by hardcoded pubkey).
- Studio rebuilds itself with the new pages — bulletproof against Svelte runtime fragmentation (we tried dynamic component loading; it broke. Postmortem in `git log alpha.71..alpha.74`).
- Both engine routes and Studio pages appear without engine restart for the API layer.

Build your own: `zveltio extension init <name>` scaffolds. `zveltio extension publish` signs + uploads. Full guide: [docs/EXTENSION-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md](docs/EXTENSION-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md).

## Zveltio vs alternatives

A platform, not a category. Here's where it lands relative to neighbours:

| | **Zveltio** | Salesforce / Monday / HubSpot | Odoo | Supabase / Pocketbase | Retool / Tooljet |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-hosted** | ✅ | ❌ SaaS only | ✅ | partial (community) | partial (paid) |
| **License** | MIT | proprietary | LGPL / proprietary | Apache / MIT | Elastic / proprietary |
| **Modern stack** | ✅ TS + Bun | N/A | ❌ Python / PHP era | ✅ TS | ✅ TS |
| **AI-native** | ✅ | partial | ❌ | partial | partial |
| **Per-seat fee** | ❌ | $30-300 / seat / mo | partial | tier-based | $10-50 / user / mo |
| **Plugin ecosystem** | ✅ open, growing | ✅ closed marketplace | ✅ ERP-shaped | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Custom code first-class** | ✅ | platform-only | constrained | ✅ | constrained (low-code) |
| **GDPR built-in** | ✅ | bolted on | partial | partial | partial |
| **Total ownership** | ✅ MIT + self-host | ❌ | partial | partial | partial |

We're closest to **Odoo conceptually** (full business platform with plugins) but rebuilt on a modern stack with AI as a first-class concern, not an afterthought. We're closest to **Salesforce Platform / Microsoft Power Platform** in the "build your business apps on this foundation" sense — but FOSS, self-hosted, and a fraction of the cost.

---

## Who's it for

✅ **Software agencies** building custom apps for clients — reduce boilerplate 60-70%, ship in weeks not months.

✅ **SMEs and mid-market** consolidating their SaaS stack — replace 8-15 subscriptions with one self-hosted platform.

✅ **Vertical SaaS founders** — legal-tech, real-estate, healthcare, ag-tech, education-LMS. Don't rewrite auth.

✅ **Enterprises and public sector** with data-sovereignty requirements — data stays on your hardware.

✅ **Startups** that need a full business stack but don't have €3-5K / month for SaaS.

❌ **Not for**: bloggers (use WordPress / Ghost), pure mobile-app backends (use Supabase / Firebase), single-purpose CRUD apps (use a boilerplate), teams with zero ops capability (use managed SaaS).

**Engine** is framework-agnostic. We ship a Svelte 5 Studio + Intranet + Client zones, but you can replace any of them with a custom React / Vue / HTMX UI that consumes `/api/*`. The plugin marketplace is Svelte-first because the bundled Studio is Svelte; the engine API is open to anyone.

---

## Beta caveats

Honest about where we are: **3.0.0-beta.21** as of the latest release.

> **Why 3.x while still beta?** Early in the project a few npm packages were
> mis-published at `2.0.x` (those version numbers can never be reused). The
> line was realigned to `3.0.0` so `npm i @zveltio/*` resolves to real code
> with no collision. "beta" is the platform maturity, independent of the
> now-3.x number. See the CHANGELOG `[3.0.0-beta.1]` entry.

**What's API-stable in beta (will NOT break between beta.x and v1.0):**
- Extension manifest v2 (`engine.bundled`, `engine.isolation`,
  `integrity.engineSha256`, `bundlePeers`)
- `ZveltioExtension` SDK interface + `@zveltio/sdk/extension` types
- `@zveltio/sdk/build` plugin config (custom build pipelines)
- Marketplace publish flow + review queue endpoints
- Worker isolation contract (no DB credentials in worker, ping/pong heartbeat, crash respawn)

**What may still move in beta.x:**
- Engine internal helpers not exported via SDK
- Studio admin UI layout + components
- Beta releases may introduce schema migrations (run via `zveltio start` auto-migrate)

✅ **Stable enough for**: production self-hosted deploys, agency-built apps, internal tools, vertical SaaS, custom platforms with engineering ownership.

⚠️ **Not yet for**: business-critical paths in regulated industries (no SOC2 / ISO 27001 yet — those are post-1.0), enterprise contracts requiring formal SLAs, headless multi-region at scale without operational maturity.

**Marketplace controlled launch**: community extension submissions are technically accepted, but every submission lands `pending` and stays there until an admin approves manually via `apps.zveltio.com/admin/marketplace/*` or the `zveltio admin marketplace` CLI. The review team and SLA are documented as operator decisions in [`docs/MARKETPLACE-POLICY.md`](docs/MARKETPLACE-POLICY.md) §9.

**Production stability**: the underlying stack (Postgres + Bun + Hono + Better-Auth + Casbin) is production-mature. We test on every commit (399 unit + 148 integration tests in CI).

**Alpha track EOL**: `1.0.0-alpha.*` is **closed** as of beta.1 (2026-05-31). Last alpha: **alpha.129**. We do not publish new alpha tags; releases stay on GitHub for audit only. **Install beta** (`get.zveltio.com`) or run `zveltio update --version 3.0.0-beta.21`. Full policy: [docs/ALPHA-TRACK-EOL.md](docs/ALPHA-TRACK-EOL.md).

**Migration from alpha**: see [docs/MIGRATION-ALPHA-TO-BETA.md](docs/MIGRATION-ALPHA-TO-BETA.md). If you ran any alpha.111+ release you'll auto-migrate cleanly; for older alpha-track installs the migration is one-way.

**v1.0 target**: tracked in [docs/REFACTORING-V1-PLAN.md](docs/REFACTORING-V1-PLAN.md) (extension platform: ✅ done at beta.1; remaining v1.0 work is product/GTM — benchmarks, demo.zveltio.com, case studies).
