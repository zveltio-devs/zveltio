# Troubleshooting Workflows

Where to look when a workflow fails, hangs, or does the wrong thing.

## Log Locations

Workflow run logs are written as JSONL per run:

```text
~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/logs/<run-id>.jsonl
```

Each line is a structured event. The discriminator is the `type` field. Values (see `packages/workflows/src/logger.ts` for the canonical list):

| `type` | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `workflow_start` / `workflow_complete` / `workflow_error` | Run lifecycle |
| `node_start` / `node_complete` / `node_error` / `node_skipped` | Node lifecycle |
| `assistant` | AI assistant message — has `content` field with the full AI output |
| `tool` | SDK tool invocation — has `tool_name` and `tool_input` |
| `exec_output` | What a `bash`/`script` node or `until_bash` probe printed — `stdout_tail`, `stderr_tail`, `exit_code` |
| `validation` | Historical compatibility only; current runs do not emit this type |

> **Loop iteration lifecycle events are NOT in the JSONL file.** `loop_iteration_started` / `loop_iteration_completed` go through the workflow event emitter (WebSocket / `workflow_events` DB table) — query the DB or the Web UI dashboard for those. Per-iteration rows that DO reach the JSONL are keyed `<node-id>-iteration-<n>`: a loop's `node_complete` row, and the `exec_output` row for each `until_bash` probe.

Find the run ID from `archon workflow runs --status failed` (or `archon workflow runs` for the most recent run of any status; `workflow status` only shows active runs). Then:

```bash
# Last assistant message (what the AI said before failure)
jq -sr 'map(select(.type == "assistant") | .content) | last // empty' <log-file>

# All error events (node failures + workflow-level failures)
jq 'select(.type == "node_error" or .type == "workflow_error")' <log-file>

# What a specific node actually printed (evidence for "did this really do X?")
jq 'select(.type == "exec_output" and .step == "<node-id>")' <log-file>

# Full event stream
cat <log-file> | jq .
```

Adapter logs (Slack / Telegram / Web / GitHub) are emitted to stderr when `LOG_LEVEL=debug` is set on the server.

## Artifact Locations

```text
~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/artifacts/runs/<run-id>/
```

Inspect artifacts when a multi-node workflow produces wrong output. The failing node's upstream artifact is usually where the problem originated.

Nodes with `output_type:` also get engine-written sidecars under `runs/<run-id>/nodes/` (`<node-id>.md` + `<node-id>.meta.json`), and — for session-persisted workflows — mirrored copies under `artifacts/scopes/<workflow>/<scope>/nodes/` that survive across runs.

```bash
ls ~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/artifacts/runs/<run-id>/
cat ~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/artifacts/runs/<run-id>/issues/issue-42.md
```

Artifacts are **external** to the repo on purpose — they don't pollute git.

## Common Failure Modes

### "No base branch could be resolved"

A node references `$BASE_BRANCH` in its prompt, but neither git auto-detection nor `worktree.baseBranch` in `.archon/config.yaml` produced a branch.

**Fix:**
1. Set `worktree.baseBranch: main` (or `dev`, or whatever) in `.archon/config.yaml`.
2. Or pass `--from <branch>` on `archon workflow run`.
3. Or remove the `$BASE_BRANCH` reference if the node doesn't actually need it.

### "Claude Code not found" / "Codex CLI binary not found"

Compiled-binary builds of Archon no longer embed Claude Code / Codex — you install them separately and Archon resolves the binary via env var or config.

**Fix (Claude):**
- Install: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` (or `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Set `CLAUDE_BIN_PATH=/path/to/claude` in `~/.archon/.env`, OR
- Set `assistants.claude.claudeBinaryPath: /absolute/path` in `.archon/config.yaml`
- Autodetect covers `$HOME/.local/bin/claude` (native installer) — no config needed if you used that path

**Fix (Codex):**
- Install: `npm install -g @openai/codex` (or platform-specific instructions)
- Set `CODEX_CLI_PATH=/path/to/codex` or `assistants.codex.codexBinaryPath` in config
- Autodetect covers the standard npm / Homebrew locations per platform

See [archon.diy/getting-started/installation/](https://archon.diy/getting-started/installation/) for full platform-specific install paths.

### Workflow shows `running` for a long time but nothing happens

Three possibilities:

1. **The AI is actually working.** Check `~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/logs/<run-id>.jsonl` — if you see recent `tool` or `assistant` events in the tail, it's fine. Wait.
2. **The server crashed and left an orphan row.** Server startup no longer auto-fails orphaned `running` rows (per the "No Autonomous Lifecycle Mutation" rule — `CLAUDE.md`). Transition it manually:
   - Web UI: Dashboard → Abandon or Cancel button on the run card
   - CLI live detached owner: `archon workflow cancel <run-id>` — stops the exact CLI `--detach` process tree before marking the row cancelled
   - CLI verified orphan: `archon workflow abandon <run-id>` — marks the DB row cancelled without claiming to stop host work
   - Chat (Slack / Telegram / Web): `/workflow cancel` in the conversation that owns the active run
3. **A node is past its `idle_timeout`.** The default is 30 minutes of complete silence (the timer resets on every streamed message — it's a deadlock detector, not a work limiter). Override with per-node `idle_timeout` (ms) if a node legitimately goes quiet for longer.

### Workflow fails mid-way; how do I resume?

Find the failed run, then resume it explicitly:

```bash
archon workflow runs
archon workflow get <run-id>
archon workflow resume <run-id>
```

`archon workflow resume <run-id>` targets that exact run and reuses its recorded working path/worktree. As a convenience, `archon workflow run my-workflow --resume` resumes the most recent resumable run for that workflow at the invocation cwd. A bare `archon workflow run my-workflow` starts a fresh run.

**Session caveat:** A cold resume does not reconstruct the ambient sequential
`context: shared` cursor. Explicit `context: { resume: node-id }` ancestry is
restored from saved run-scoped handles, and an interactive loop with
`fresh_context: false` resumes its pre-pause session when the provider supports
it. Artifact-based handoff remains the provider-independent path.

### Approval gate not appearing on web UI

The workflow has an approval node but still runs in the background and no chat message appears.

**Fix:** Set `interactive: true` at the **workflow level**. Node-level `interactive` is not a supported field; the loader ignores it and warns that the key is unknown.

### `MCP server connection failed: <plugin>` noise in chat

User-level Claude plugin MCPs (e.g. `telegram`, `notion`) inherited from `~/.claude/` fail to connect in the headless subprocess. This is normal — they're not configured for Archon's worktree context. Archon filters these to debug logs (`dag.mcp_plugin_connection_suppressed`) and surfaces only workflow-configured MCP failures.

If you see a failure for an MCP you DID configure via `mcp:` in the workflow: check the config JSON path, the MCP server's `command`/`args`, and any referenced env vars.

### A node was skipped and I don't know why

Skips carry a **reason** in the persisted `node_skipped` event (`archon workflow get <run-id> --verbose --json`, or the `workflow_events` table):

| Reason | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `trigger_rule` | Upstream states didn't satisfy the join rule (default `all_success` — a skipped upstream counts as not-success and cascades) | Use `one_success` / `none_failed_min_one_success` / `all_done` on merge nodes after `when:`-gated branches |
| `when_condition` | The `when:` expression evaluated false | Expected behavior — check the upstream output it compared against |
| `when_condition_parse_error` | The `when:` expression has invalid SYNTAX — fail-closed skip | Fix the expression (six operators, `&&`/`\|\|`, no parentheses) |
| `prior_success` | Resume: the node completed in a prior run | Expected; use `always_run: true` to force re-execution |

### Node FAILED with an `OutputRefError`-style message about `$node.output.field`

Not a skip — strict field access failed loudly: the field isn't in the producer's `output_format` schema (typo), the schemaless producer's output isn't JSON / lacks the key, or the producer never ran. Fix the reference, add the field to the schema, or guard with `when:`/`trigger_rule`. (Only whole-text `$node.output` degrades silently to `''`.)

### Node output is empty / a declared-optional field resolves to empty string

Common causes:

1. Upstream node was **skipped** — whole-text `$node.output` is `''` for skipped producers.
2. The field is declared in the producer's `output_format` but was absent/null in the actual output (declared-optional → `''` by design).
3. Bash/script node printed to stderr, not stdout. Only stdout is captured.
4. For script nodes, non-zero exit on a non-existent file / missing import fails the node. Check the run log for `node_error` entries.

### A workflow-level field seems to have no effect

Invalid values for optional workflow-level fields (`interactive`, `effort`, `thinking`, `sandbox`, `fallbackModel`, `betas`, `tags`, `worktree.enabled`, `mutates_checkout`) are **warn-and-drop**: the workflow still loads and runs, the field is discarded, and a loader warning is logged. Same for AI-only fields on bash/script nodes (`*_node_ai_fields_ignored`). Grep the server/CLI logs for `_ignored` / warn entries before assuming the field is broken.

### Persisted session didn't restore (cold resume)

A `persist_session` node whose provider couldn't restore the prior session runs FRESH with a warning (it does not fail). The warning includes pointers to prior typed artifacts (`output_type` sidecars in the cross-run scope dir) so the prompt/agent can re-read lost context. If sessions are repeatedly cold, check server logs; clear broken state with `archon workflow reset-sessions <workflow>`.

## Useful Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Environment sanity first: binaries, gh auth, DB, adapters
archon doctor

# One run, any status, with raw events — the fastest "why did node X skip/fail"
archon workflow get <run-id> --verbose --events --json | jq '.events[]'

# Recent runs for this project, all statuses ("did the review pass?")
archon workflow runs --json | jq '.runs[]'

# Recent runs of any status (find a failed run's ID)
archon workflow runs --status failed --limit 10

# Active runs for this project (running / paused only — finished runs never appear here)
archon workflow status --json | jq '.runs[]'

# Active runs across all projects
archon workflow status --all --json | jq '.runs[]'

# Human-readable status of any active runs
archon workflow status

# Active worktrees and their last activity
archon isolation list

# Validate a specific workflow before running
archon validate workflows my-workflow

# Validate a specific command
archon validate commands my-command

# Dump the last 50 lines of a workflow's log
tail -n 50 ~/.archon/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>/logs/<run-id>.jsonl | jq .

# Increase log verbosity (workflow run)
archon workflow run my-workflow --verbose "..."

# Increase server log verbosity
LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run start
```

## Escalation: when nothing makes sense

1. Run `archon version` and note the version.
2. Run `archon validate workflows <name>` and capture the output.
3. Grab the last ~50 lines of the run's JSONL log.
4. Check the `CHANGELOG.md` for known issues / recent changes to the subsystem you're hitting.
5. File an issue at https://github.com/coleam00/Archon/issues with version, validate output, log tail, and the YAML.
